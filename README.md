#### Introduction
In this project I worked on the Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in the Indian market. I build a deep learning classification model to determine if there will be listing gains for the IPO. Listing gains are the percentage increase in the share price of a company from its IPO issue price on the day of listing.

The dataset for this project contains information on past IPOs in the Indian market and comes from [moneycontrol](https://www.moneycontrol.com/ipo/ipo-historic-table?classic=true).
